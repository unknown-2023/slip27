from django.shortcuts import render 
# Create your views here.

views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello! I am learning Django")

Create a URL Mapping
In the same app directory, create a urls.py file (e.g., myapp/urls.py) if it doesn't exist, and define a URL mapping for your view:
urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]

Configure the Project URL Routing
Open the project's urls.py file (e.g., myproject/urls.py) and include the URL patterns of your app:
urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),			//already existing in the urls.py file
    path('', include('myapp.urls')),			//add line for url routing
]

Run the Development Server
python manage.py runserver

Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
